      "good morning everybody to 8 pm last night there were just over 95 000 tests done in new south wales and it's really important as we always say to keep those testing rates high uh pm yesterday there were 262 cases of community transmission with at least 50 of those infectious in the community during that time and as we've seen in the last few days the numbers are bouncing around a bit but clearly reduce those numbers and i urge everybody to please stick to the rules follow the health advice and only leave home if you absolutely have to unfortunately overnight there was one death of a woman in her eighties who was not vaccinated and dr mcnulty will provide further information about that in relation to the virus canterbury bankstown local government area still remains the epicenter of the most cases obviously all local government suburbs within the canterbury bankstown area and adjoining areas are under risk of transmission it's again creating the highest number of cases and as deputy commissioner warboys will outline that has been the focus also of police compliance with extra presence on the ground making sure people are doing the right thing on a more positive note health experts advise us that if people in the georges river a local government area come forward for higher rates of testing in the next few days that local government area is likely to be taken out of an area of concern but so can i please urge everybody who lives in the georgia's river local government area especially in those suburbs adjoining the local government areas of concern please come out and get tested if you have the mildest of symptoms that will give the health experts confidence to take the georgia's river local government area out of those areas of concern and congratulations to people in that area who've been following the advice doing the right thing and have seen a reduction in the number of cases regrettably however there are 12 suburbs in the penrith local government area that will be now listed as an area of concern will be subjected to those harsher uh restrictions that we've imposed on those eight local government areas dr mcnulty will read what those twelve suburbs are but they're clearly suburbs that are boundaries to those other eight local government areas and we want to make sure that we stem the tide of the virus seeping into those additional communities and as i said dr mcinalton will read what those 12 suburbs are and we asked residents from five o'clock this afternoon to adhere to the additional restrictions placed upon them uh pleasingly new south wales now has uh made sure that there are 4.4 million jabs in arms now that is positive we're doing really well in terms of increasing the number of people getting vaccinated every day and can i urge everybody who hasn't had it have at least one dose of the vaccine to come forward and get vaccinated every adult should be coming forward and getting vaccinated and we urge everybody to please do that as you all know in homebush today we're focusing on any worker in who works in supermarkets or face-to-face food retail uh there are thousands of people who've already booked to come in and get their jab today but it's also um allowable for people to walk in today if you want a jab especially if you work in front line food services please come forward today to homebush and get a jab the vaccination center there is open till 4 pm and whilst we do have a couple of thousand bookings already there is capacity for people to come forward it's a rainy day if you don't have symptoms and you're not in isolation you're not a close contact and you're not someone of concern please come forward and get the jab can i also stress again how important it is for us to to fight this outbreak through the lockdown through everybody doing the right thing but also through getting vaccinated and they are the two tools we have to reduce the case numbers and look forward to a future which has fewer restrictions and i really really urge everybody to stay at home unless they absolutely have to and secondly of course come forward and get the jab if they haven't dr mcnulty will now provide the health update and deputy commissioner boys will talk about police compliance efforts thank you thanks premier and good morning everyone there were 262 locally acquired cases of the covert 19 reported in new south wales for 24 hours to 8 o'clock last night there are also six overseas uh acquired cases to eight o'clock last night there were 95 480 tests reported until eight o'clock last night compared to the previous day's total of 108 449. in terms of cases in hospital we are seeing large numbers of people with covert admitted to hospital there are 362 cases admitted to hospital with 58 in intensive care and 24 requiring ventilation of the 58 cases in intensive care five are in their twenties seven in their thirties four in their forties seventeen in their fifties seven in their sixties fifteen in their seventies and three in their 80s so young people are certainly getting caught up with this disease of the 58 people in icu 54 were not vaccinated three had received their first dose of astrazeneca and one had received their first dose of pfizer vaccine sadly as premier mentioned new south wales health has been notified of the death of a person with covert 19 is a woman in her 80s who was a resident of the wyoming residential aged care facility in summerhill and she died in royal prince alfred hospital she testified tested positive for covert 19 on the 1st of august and was admitted to hospital that day we extend our sincere sympathies to the family and loved ones of that person she was not vaccinated we've had positive sewage detections in dubbo and low levels in maji so we're asking people to come forward for testing those communities there's no known cases in those communities so we need to be extra vigilant wherever we see sewerage in communities without known cases so that come please come forward for testing if you have even the mild symptoms if you live in dubbo or maji the premier mentioned additional restrictions for 12 suburbs in the city of penrith now we've seen the front of the epidemic move into parts of penrith adjacent to the areas in western sydney and southwestern sydney so we're concerned and the additional restrictions will help contain that outbreak emerging there the sub suburbs affected which are adjacent to cumberland and liverpool lgas caddens clermont meadows colton erskine park kemp's creek kingswood mount vernon north saint mary's orchard hills oxley park sinclair and saint mary's in line with the restrictions currently in place in blacktown campbelltown country bankstown cumberland fairfield georges river liverpool and parramatta lgas people in these 12 suburbs must only obtain food or other goods and services and exercise within five kilometres of their home you can't travel to other areas of work outside those areas unless you're an authorised worker masks must be worn whenever you're outdoors except in a common outdoor area of a backyard apartment for example and masks do not have to be worn while you're in a car with other members of your family thanks very much good morning thank you dr premier 454 penalty infringement notices issued right across new south wales in the last 24 hours by police 171 of those were issued in southwest and northwest sydney police continue to have a focus in the canterbury bankstown and kempsey area yesterday whilst the vast majority of people in that specific lga were doing the right thing police were still confronted by people who were outside of their homes with out a reasonable excuse buying simple goods but then hanging around and talking and gathering and putting not just themselves at risk but their family at risk where they would return home and they could well spread the virus it's unfortunate that this focus continues and it will continue until such times as the infections and the transmissions in those areas begin to fall away new south wales police every single day look at where the infections where the transmissions are what are the lgas of concern and they task police resources to those areas the agility of new south wales police is right across new south wales we will move resources around that's local resources from districts and police area commands traffic and highway patrol other specialist police and continued focus on our transport system yesterday we also seen along the beaches we now have a an operation that works every single day on the beaches the sydney beaches up and down making sure that people who are exercising continue to do that that they are not gathering in spaces that again poses a risk to themselves and the community new south wales police would like to thank those people in south west sydney that continue to do the right thing and make our job easy but the message is really clear if you are one of those people that want to go outside of the public health orders if you are one of those people that want to put the risk in terms of your own safety that of your family that of the community we will we will come we will issue the infringement notices we will direct you to comply with the public health orders and i guess what's important is that crime stoppers continues to receive around a thousand calls every single day from people in the community that want to tell us about those that are breaching public health orders it's not just in terms of your own actions but what you are doing is actually uh putting the actions uh it's not just your own actions but it's what you're doing to your community to your family and to this state every single person wants to get out of this pandemic wants to get out of the lockdown arrangements as quickly as possible don't be one of those people that put that at jeopardy i'm just trying to get my head around the science clearly uh the statistics show that the vaccinations are preventing people from getting serious illness and being an ico i mean that's just pure mathematics to what extent are vaccinations preventing people from even getting the illness yes so vaccinations work well the the best effect is for preventing serious disease with very high rates of preventing people getting into hospital they also work well in preventing disease and infectiousness to other people but that's at a lower level than the the the main effect the the highest level of effect is in preventing that serious disease but they do and are very effective in preventing infection in the first place and your ability to transmit to other people these are 12 suburbs within the penrith lga they're under the same restrictions as the other lgas right and that includes you can't leave and for work unless you're an essential authorized worker does that mean that they can't leave their suburb or they can't leave the penrith lga they can't relieve the nrflga to um to go be an authorised worker so you can go the rules are on the well are on the website but you can need to get food you can leave your house one person at a time one day you can leave the house to get food you can leave for if you're an authorised worker leave the lga to do authorised work they can go out of their suburb within the five kilometres to shop and they can go out of their suburb if they're an authorised worker to work within the henrietta lga that's correct dr mcnulty can you tell us the proportion of healthcare workers that are vaccinated i don't have that figure we can get that back to you at the moment i don't have in my head but certainly uh healthcare workers are offered vaccination and we've got higher and higher levels of vaccination in healthcare workers and of course this is the most important thing you can do as a healthcare worker is to get vaccinated as well as following excellent infection control practices so we've got great training in our health system for health workers and awareness and offering vaccine to to health care workers doctor do you have a another positive case at royal north shore or northern beaches northern beaches i don't we'll have to get back to you about the detail we do have cases in northern sydney uh and we have case in that in the media release we have identified where the cases are um there's not a concern within the northern beaches hospital of a positive case presenting there i don't have information at this point doctor you've got um vaccination hubs at macquarie fields home bush and you've mentioned penrith is there any desire to have a mass vaccination hub out west should i let you take that all right yeah sorry um uh well certainly we have a number of mass vaccination hubs up and running already so obviously from tomorrow kudos bank arena also will become a mass vaccination hub initially we'll be doing the hse students in those areas of concern but then following this week that will be reverted to a mass vaccination hub we have a walk-in hub at prairie wood we also have a number of mobile hubs so we're advertising or promoting to local residents in those areas of concern places where there are mobile walk-in centres as well around places of worship community centres so we're doing both strategies mass vaccination hubs working with the gps working with the pharmacists but also having those mobile hubs as well where people are comfortable coming forward we're essentially covering all bases to make sure that whether it's a mass vaccination hub whether it's through your gp or pharmacist or those mobile places going out to the community through community outreach that we have our bases covered including working with industry and can i thank industry for their enthusiasm in trying to get their workers vaccinated it's pleasing to note that thousands of workers in supermarkets and food retail across those areas of concern are coming forward to get vaccinated today and i want to call out 20 others who may not have booked the homebush centre is open to 4 pm today so i urge you to come forward and get vaccinated especially if you work in those industries we're really keen to vaccinate all of our authorized workers all those people who have to be mobile but who may be living in those areas of concern and unfortunately at highest risk of either spreading or getting the virus and that's what we're trying to reduce in the next few few days to ask you about the construction industry opening up on wednesday can you give us some clarification on what the rules will be free for all rapid antigen testing on site what what are we going to be looking at uh well certainly information has already been provided publicly on those matters but in relation to the construction industry can i thank the industry for working closely with government and for working with us to make vaccinations and incentive to get back to work so if if you live in one of those areas of concern you're in the construction industry and want to get back to work we're urging you to work with your employers to get vaccinated to ensure a safe return to work and please know that whilst there isn't any rules in place to mandate vaccinations there will be incentives offered for people to get back to work and to get back to doing what they want to do if you are vaccinated so can i urge people now to come forward and get vaccinated especially if you're in a job which traditionally has a lot to do with people has a face-to-face contact we know that the vaccine takes three weeks to become effective either vaccine so we encourage you to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that we have options moving forward into september about how we can live more freely has the government considered or would it be helpful to look at door-to-door vaccination rollouts medical professionals going door-to-door and some of these well what we do well the best option for us is to vaccinate large numbers of people in the shortest amount of time so the max vaccination hubs are working really well the take-up with pharmacists and gps is working really well people obviously trust their gp and trust their pharmacist for that additional information and they're familiar to them so we're responding to what has the best health outcome but whatever also is responding well with through the community and we're considering all those options uh but please know that um you need to be careful when you consider door-to-door to make sure that you're not exposing people to the virus and that's why it's really important for us to encourage people to go through their gp go through their pharmacist book into one of our mass vaccination hubs or through their communities we're providing information at a grassroots level as to where those mobile vaccination hubs are and how people can go to a trusted place they've been too many times in order to get the vaccination um new south wales union survey is just revealed at about i'm sorry i didn't get the first part of the question new south wales union survey of about 3 000 essential workers has revealed that about 50 of them say that they feel unsupported throughout this outbreak by their employers what is the government doing to offer them support and and also while i've got you what do you say to the mass misinformation that's spreading about vaccines on social media and the accusations that the government has an agenda with promoting the vaccines yeah firstly can i thank the industry the business community for working with government we have found overall their response to be extremely positive in supporting their workers to get vaccinated and keeping their workplaces safe so uh whenever we have had conversations with business and industry they've been very uh encouraging in relation to vaccinating their employees and making sure their employees have the opportunity to be vaccinated that has been our overwhelming uh response uh and we urge every employer to consider the well-being of their employees and workplaces and of course it's in everybody's interests because if there is a covert outbreak in your workplace your workplace will be closed down so there's incentive for people to to operate safe work environments which is obviously good for employees but most importantly good for employees as well as employers and that is critical in relation to misinformation there'll be misinformation on a whole range of issues including vaccination so i always say you don't need to listen to me but you do need to listen to the health experts speak to your gpa your pharmacist your community leader who's been provided with information we have targeted grassroots information to so many diverse communities there's over 200 different communities of diverse backgrounds in greater western sydney something our state's very proud of but also something that we need to acknowledge and so we've had very targeted approaches through community leaders through people who are respected by by uh community groups and that has proved really useful as well so we ask to if you have any concerns please ask your gpa your pharmacist or of course contact new south wales health premier would you be open just to giving an update on your views about what might happen post august 28 cases and vaccinations notwithstanding yeah look we're tracking well to hit our six million target and uh we are now in our forties in terms of forty percentage range in terms of people with two doses in in new south wales or at least one dose so we're we're sticking to our targets and i'm really keen to get to six million jabs by the end of august because that will provide us opportunities to consider what life looks like in september and we're really keen to really um sprint this is a race we're keen to sprint to get those vaccination rates up because as dr mcnulty and health experts say not only does it keep people out of hospital but it also prevents the virus spreading prevents people getting the virus and we know um that life will look very different once we get to 70 vaccination and 80 vaccination but until we get to 70 we need to consider what restrictions will be in place until we hit that target and how can we live more freely than we are now today and i want to be very clear about that it doesn't mean that we'll return to pre-outbreak conditions but what it does mean is that september can be a month where we have greater freedom than what we do now but there are two things conditional on that it's making sure that we keep case numbers as low as possible plus we keep vaccinating and we know the future freedom relies on vaccination and there's no doubt about that but it also means having to suppress the lockdown is an opportunity for us to suppress and get those numbers down but we know that uh life with the delta strain means some level of restriction until we get those vaccination rates uh as high as possible sorry you haven't asked the question just in terms of getting to that six million target i think everybody's working towards that but we don't know what we get for the six million is there something that you're looking at is it schools you say schools as a priority getting people back to work is that are they the first things that you're looking at for the six million target well obviously for us our priorities as a government are getting face-to-face learning back but also getting workers back to the workplaces and that means a whole number of things if certain categories of workers go back to work it also means that all citizens will have access to perhaps services they don't have access to today and that's really keen for us so it will really depend on the advice from health experts but we are looking at opportunities in relation to education and work but having said that when you get people back to work it could be an industry where people rely on for service in that industry and it could have a benefit as well to citizens so we're looking at those options but can i please urge people to come forward and get vaccinated i can't stress that enough if you have concerns please speak to your health professional your gp your pharmacist that you trust or else contact new south wales health but higher rates of vaccination will help us deal with this outbreak it's not the only answer we've never said that obviously lockdown and restrictions have their role but vaccination is the key to reducing the spread to reducing the number of people that need hospitalization and we've seen to date as horrible as every death is there still hasn't been a death where people have received both doses of either vaccine and that's something positive it means that the vaccine is having a positive impact and i can't urge people enough to come forward and get vaccinated regarding the construction workers in the hot zones how will you check if they've been vaccinated how will you know uh well obviously there is now an application through medicare that provides you with evidence that you've been vaccinated there's also proof of vaccination you can receive when you get vaccinated so there's multiple ways and this is about employers employees working together to substantiate compliance but we're very pleased that industry supported the government's view that vaccination is key to having covert free workplaces especially in those areas of concern so whilst those obligations or those incentives don't exist for people outside those areas of concern given where the numbers are if we want workers back in the workplace in a safe way well then obviously vaccination is key to that process it's a combination of vaccination but also testing to make sure that workplaces are as safe as possible and i want to thank industry for supporting those incentives nothing is mandatory but we know that if we encourage people to get vaccinated as a way of getting back to work that that is really encouraging people into the future alex and then james on testing um there's an exposure site in the port stephens lga people are being encouraged to come forward and get tested there's no sunday testing facilities in port stephens why is that and and what what happens for that i don't know the answer to that question um but we can look at port stephens health testing yeah yeah we'll look into that um but i wasn't aware of that alex so what do those people do today that are being told to come forward and get tested uh well obviously if it's six days out of seven at the moment um i don't know about that seventh day but we'll take advice on that um in relation to the cases today right 86 only 86 cases were in isolation for their whole infectious period of 262. a doctor chant on thursday spoke about the fact that uh there is more the government can do to intervene in transmission of the virus she's been talking to paul kelly to commonwealth counterpart about a circuit breaker apart from increasing vaccination rates is there anything or will you do anything more to intervene in transmission paths or not and if not will you level with the people of new south wales to say that we're going to be locked out of the rest of the country until the whole country gets to 80 of the population being vaccinated well no can i firstly say this that um dr chant confirmed with me her conversations with her federal counterparts on the need to get a small vaccines she's been very open about that i've been very open about that and we know that vaccination is a key tool it's a tool we didn't have a year ago it's a tool which australia didn't have some time ago but now we do have the tool and it's important for us to use all the tools we have in order to curb the number of the spread to to curb the number of people getting the disease but also obviously to keep people out of hospital and we know that once you have a certain population vaccinated that will also mean that we focus more on hospitalization numbers as opposed to case numbers and that's really important it is really up to us as to how quickly we get vaccinated it's up to us as to how quickly we can look forward to additional freedoms and that's why i stated the community please know that our government your government is focused on a higher vaccination rates as a way of us having greater freedoms in the month of september and that is something that we're really looking forward to those additional freedoms only come with vaccination rates double dose vaccination rates of 70 or 80 no that's not correct the dota report is very clear those rates of 1780 refer to freedom's pre the outbreak but we are currently in lockdown lockdown plus some level of easing of restrictions is possible uh once we get to 50 or 60 rates of vaccination i want to be very clear about this some people are conflating the two issues so the doherty report is an outstanding report which the new south wales government supports and of course what it does is suggest that once you get your 70 vaccination you can then focus on the number of hospitalizations as opposed to the number of cases and that's really a mind shift on how we live with covert but until we get to 70 there's opportunities for us to ease restrictions currently uh that we don't or to ease restrictions that are currently in place once you get to a certain level of vaccination and that's a different proposition but one that new south wales is looking closely at and i made those views clear at national cabinet last friday you're completely at odds with the prime minister here who says that not at all you can't vaccinate yourself out of a lockdown in fact the prime minister at national cabinet um and he said it publicly afterwards acknowledged that because new south wales is in lockdown if we hit certain vaccination targets we can ease some restrictions it doesn't mean you get to what you would ease if you're at 70 percent but there's certainly opportunities for us to look at what we can ease in in september so long as we hit our vaccination targets so long as we get at least six million jabs by the end of august we can look for opportunities as to how we live in the month of september have we got any information are there any more cases there have people there turned out for testing yeah i understand there's one additional case there which is in the media update that health will be providing and obviously health will advise us what should happen at the end of that lockdown period drop in cases is that sign do you think that the tide has turned or tide is turning what should we interpret anything from that well no i think unfortunately a day doesn't doesn't make a trend uh the numbers are clearly bouncing around and we want to see them consistently go down at the moment it's a bit inconsistent although we're not growing exponentially there's always concern about that tipping point where you start to see exponential growth we certainly haven't seen that which is one positive but obviously a trend is if you have successive days of reduction in numbers and we don't have that yet it's only a day but obviously um you know as the days go past the more people that get tested the more people that come forward and get vaccinated gives us our best shot literally of reducing the case numbers overall where did you get from you had a positive case of the bulger bright coal mine any chance the north west could go into lockdown um i did hear about that case but um health experts are looking at that and we haven't received any advice to that yet where did you get your this 50 vaccination figure your figure of six million target most of those first doses some second doses fifty percent the new south wales government has uh observed carefully what is occurring in overseas jurisdictions our health experts in fact have been in touch with what is happening in places like canada and provinces with a similar size to new south wales and what they went through and clearly the evidence shows us that a targeted vaccination strategy in areas of concern has a massive impact on reducing cases and allowing you to get outbreaks under control but also what life can look like if you look at overseas jurisdictions they've certainly been far less conservative than us as to what they've allowed people to do at 50 but the difference with us in new south wales and australia is fortunately until this point in time we've had a much lower mortality rate and much lower case numbers in other places around the world and so therefore it's really important for us to look at what is acceptable for new south wales in australia in terms of what we do ease moving forward but i do also believe based on the health advice that when you get to 50 60 um vaccination rates it does give you opportunity to ease some restrictions ah ahead of that 70 percent number when we literally have a change in in thought we transition from going from talking about case numbers to talking about hospitalizations and that's a big shift but we have some time ahead of us to to make sure that all of us are comfortable in talking about it in that way and as dr chan and dr mcnulty and other health experts will say we'll get to a stage when you have those high rates of vaccination where you can start treating the delta strain as you would the flu where you talk about the number of people in hospital as opposed to the number of cases but we can't do that until we get to that eighty percent but between seventy and eighty percent vaccination that's what the doherty report says and i really do commend that report i found it a very uh useful piece of information coupled with the information we've been having from new south wales and uh ideas say that the new south wales health experts were talking about that 80 vaccination rate in adults for some months even before the report came out so it really validated our understanding of where things are going but it also validated our understanding of how vaccination is an important tool in curbing out breaks but also obviously allowing us to live more freely moving forward mr wall boys can i ask you about where you going all right so if the numbers don't move the case numbers don't move at all but we do hit the six million vaccination target you will look to easing restrictions well the one thing the other thing that health experts will look at is where the concentration of cases are occurring and at this stage the the concentration of cases whilst we've had outbreaks or um or clusters exist outside those areas the concentration of cases is not in dispute at the moment we know where the extra concentration is that's why police have in a in large force and i don't apologize for that i have really clamped down on those communities where some people unfortunately not a lot but a handful of people are willfully not doing the right thing so police have been given all the resources and are experts in those operational matters to make sure that we really clamp down on compliance it's become very obvious to us in the last few weeks where the challenging areas are in terms of the virus circulating what we need to do and as every week goes by we're learning the way delta is working the way delta is moving and the way in which we can stem that tide mr warboys can i ask you a question mr warboy it's just a question about um compliance in the early days of this you were giving people the benefit of the doubt like on the the cold face on the front line uh giving them a warning if they hadn't been pinged before etc these are daily warnings at these press conferences alone is it time that if somebody's sunbaking on a beach they just get fined regardless of whatever their excuse is do we need to get harsher in those beach areas that manly like manly and bondi that don't seem to be taking it as seriously as the rest of the rest of the city i think the uh the fact that the penalty infringement notices continue to go up uh every single day is disappointing but it's a reflection on new south wales police attitude towards people that do not want to comply with the public health orders as we continue along uh as the it's not just the beaches it's not just southwest sydney um we now look at armadale we now look at the newcastle and upper hunter area as i said the police operations center is there every single day to work with health about where the risks are and they will task police to those areas accordingly we have had a shift uh in terms of our focus but as the premier said that shift clearly correlates to people in a specific area where there is high transmission who simply do not want to do the right thing and we don't make any apologies for that new south wales police will continue to be in those locations where we see there is a need to enforce the public health orders quickly about suburbs um you \n",
